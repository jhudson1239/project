Within this folder you will see the reuslt of the two classifiers being used. The files that
are labled _textblob after the company name are the files that have been classifed using the
Textblob tool. The files with _sentiment after the comapny name are the files classified using
the projects classifier. As you can see the microsoft file is significanlty small than the others
this was due to some corruption of files. The csv files with _tweets_processed after the comapny name are the files
that where to be classified, they do not contain labels and they are the preprocssed using the scripts in the
preprocessing section.
