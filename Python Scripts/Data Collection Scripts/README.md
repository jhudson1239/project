Within this folder is the script that was used to collect positive and negative tweets from Twitter. it can be seen on code line 6, 7, 9 and 10 that the keys are present, these are to a dummy twitter account that was created just for this project. You can see within this file there is two seperate functions, get_n_tweets and get_p_tweets. Each one is resposible for either obtaining positve tweets or negative tweets. As can be seen there is a section of using regular expression to remove some of the noice within the tweets, this is the first step of pre processing in the cycle. At the bottom of the script there is a while loop that loops 100 times before stopping, this calls each function to gather positive and negative tweets.

Also within this folder is an obtain_company_tweets script, this was used to obtain tweets that mentioned the company in, to change which company was being collected the variable company value was change to the releveant one.
